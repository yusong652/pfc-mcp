  "description": "Configure clump results logic for efficient post-processing. Creates lightweight snapshots of clump geometries and selected attributes at different time instances as binary files. This logic allows for a reduced version of the model state (clump geometries plus clump attributes) to be output and used to re-create the model state. IMPORTANT: Clump result files do NOT replace PFC model state files and models re-created with this logic should not be cycled. Use with model results command to control when/how result files are created and imported.",
