  "description": "Set the rotational EOM (Equations of Motion) order for clumps (3D ONLY). Either two or four are acceptable values. The fourth order method is outlined in Johnson et al. (2008) while the second order method is outlined in Buss (2000) (augmented second order method without energy conservation). Energy is much better conserved with the fourth order scheme, but the computational cost is significantly higher. The order will remain unchanged when a model new command is given but is set to four whenever the code is launched.",
