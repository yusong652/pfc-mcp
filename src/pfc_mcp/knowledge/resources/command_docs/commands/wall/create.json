  "description": "Create a wall from vertices. IMPORTANT: In 3D, each facet must be a triangle (3 vertices). Rectangular surfaces require 2 triangular facets (6 vertices total). The number of vertex positions must be a multiple of {2 in 2D; 3 in 3D} and must represent {a vertex connected surface in 2D; an edge connected surface in 3D} that is manifold and orientable. The vertices can be input in any order as long as sets of {2 in 2D; 3 in 3D} represent a facet. In the absence of the id keyword, the next available ID is assigned. In the absence of the name keyword, the name is set to wallXX, where XX is the wall ID, provided that this name has not been previously specified. Note: A model domain must be specified prior to wall creation. All facets must fall within the model domain. While cycling, walls can only be created before cycle point 0 (i.e., when the timestep is calculated).",
