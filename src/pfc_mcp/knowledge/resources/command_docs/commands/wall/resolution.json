In all cases, contact activity based on contact with active/inactive facet sides (see wall active-sides) is determined. Note: Eliciting this command does not result in an automatic 'cleaning' of the model state. See 'Faceted Walls in PFC' section for detailed explanation of resolution strategies.",
