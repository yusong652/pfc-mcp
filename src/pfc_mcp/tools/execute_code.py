        """Execute Python code synchronously in the running PFC process.

        Returns stdout and an optional result variable immediately.
        Code runs in PFC's main thread, sharing the same __main__
        namespace as any running task — side effects persist and are
        immediately visible to the task on its next cycle.

        This tool remains responsive EVEN WHILE a simulation task is
        running (submitted via pfc_execute_task), as long as the task
        is actively cycling — execute_code interleaves at cycle gaps.
        Use it as a live REPL to inspect simulation state in real
        time — no need to pre-script print statements, and parameter
        sweeps or sentinel-based control don't have to be baked into
        the task script up front.

        Environment: PFC's embedded Python interpreter. The version
        is bundled with PFC (PFC 6/7 → Python 3.6, PFC 9 → 3.10);
        the PFC version is encoded in sys.executable (e.g. PFC700,
        PFC900). When unsure, write code compatible with Python 3.6+.

        Typical uses:
        - Query model state: ball/wall/contact counts, current cycle
        - Issue PFC commands and read their console output:
          itasca.command('ball list'), itasca.command('model list
          information'). Table dumps, list output, and command
          summaries are captured and interleaved with Python prints
          in execution order — no need to re-implement queries via
          the SDK just to see what a command would print
        - Live inspection during a running task: check forces,
          energy, coordination number, contact statistics
        - Live tuning during a running task: modify parameters,
          swap callbacks, or set sentinel variables that the task
          reads each cycle (e.g. change a servo target, adjust
          damping, signal early termination)
        - Create and export plots: itasca.command('plot ...')
        - Development and REPL-style testing

        `program call '<file>.p3dat'` (or .p2dat / .dat) through this
        tool is PFC-version-gated. On PFC 6/7 the command-script
        interpreter blocks the bridge for the script's entire
        duration with no cycle-gap interleaving — any long
        `model cycle` inside the file leaves the bridge unreachable
        until PFC is stopped manually. Never emit it there, and
        treat unknown or unverified versions (including PFC
        9.0-9.6) the same way. On PFC 9.7+ the bridge stays fully
        responsive during a `program call` (verified on 9.7: status
        polling, cycle-gap interleaving, and interrupt all work
        mid-call). Even where it is safe, prefer reading the file
        and translating its commands into a sequence of
        `itasca.command(...)` calls in Python — that keeps
        per-command output, error locality, and mid-script control
        that a single opaque `program call` cannot give.

        This is a synchronous tool: the request blocks until the code
        finishes or hits the timeout (default 10s, max 600s). Output
        is returned in full; the call is NOT tracked by pfc_list_tasks
        and cannot be interrupted mid-execution. For cancellable,
        pollable, or background work, submit it via pfc_execute_task
        instead — and you can still call pfc_execute_code against the
        task while it cycles.
