        """Submit a Python script file for asynchronous execution in PFC.

        Returns a task_id immediately; the script runs in the background.
        Use the companion tools to manage the task lifecycle:
        - pfc_check_task_status: poll output, progress, and final status
        - pfc_interrupt_task: cancel a running task
        - pfc_list_tasks: browse task history

        While the task is cycling, you can call pfc_execute_code at any
        time to inspect or modify simulation state — including variables
        the task depends on. This is the standard way to probe progress,
        tune parameters mid-run, swap callbacks, or trigger early
        termination via a sentinel variable. Both tools share the same
        __main__ namespace in PFC's main thread.

        Console output from itasca.command() inside the script —
        table dumps, list output, command summaries — is captured
        and interleaved with Python prints in the task log, visible
        through pfc_check_task_status.

        Having the script invoke `program call '<file>.p3dat'` (or
        .p2dat / .dat) is PFC-version-gated. On PFC 6/7 the
        command-script interpreter blocks the bridge for the
        script's entire duration with no cycle-gap interleaving,
        leaving the bridge unreachable until PFC is stopped
        manually. Never emit it there, and treat unknown or
        unverified versions (including PFC 9.0-9.6) the same way.
        On PFC 9.7+ the bridge stays fully responsive during a
        `program call` (verified on 9.7: status polling, cycle-gap
        interleaving, and interrupt all work mid-call). Even where
        it is safe, prefer reading the file and translating its
        commands into a sequence of `itasca.command(...)` calls in
        the Python script — that keeps per-command output, error
        locality, and mid-script control that a single opaque
        `program call` cannot give.

        This is the async / background execution path: pollable via
        pfc_check_task_status, cancellable via pfc_interrupt_task.
        Submission does not lock parameters — start with reasonable
        values and refine live via pfc_execute_code as the task
        cycles. For synchronous, inline execution, use
        pfc_execute_code directly.

        Submission uses the bridge's `execute_task` protocol message. If
        a submission times out, the connected bridge may predate it —
        confirm its version with pfc_execute_code (`import
        itasca_mcp_bridge; print(itasca_mcp_bridge.__version__)`). To
        upgrade, fetch and follow the bootstrap guide, then resubmit:
